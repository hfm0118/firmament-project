# Deepgram Transcription Frontend

This is a React frontend for the Deepgram live speech transcription application. It provides a clean, modern interface for the transcription functionality.

## Features

- Real-time speech transcription using Deepgram API
- Modern React implementation with hooks
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Clean and simple UI focused on transcription

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```
npm start
```

## Usage

1. Make sure the Flask backend server is running on port 8000 and the Flask-SocketIO server is running on port 5001.
2. Open the React app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000)
3. Click the microphone button to start/stop recording
4. Speak into your microphone to see real-time transcription

## Connection with Backend

This frontend connects to the Flask backend using:
- HTTP requests for standard API calls (port 8000)
- WebSocket for real-time communication via Socket.IO (port 5001)

The API proxy configuration is handled in `setupProxy.js`.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.js` - Main application component
- `src/components/TranscriptionMic.js` - Microphone and transcription functionality
- `src/setupProxy.js` - API proxy configuration for development

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
